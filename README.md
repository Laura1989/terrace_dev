# terrace_dev
Terrace is where designers can create easy to develop responsive portfolios to showcase their work.

Please check out a new branch and use this naming convention:

YourFirstName_Month_Day_Year <code>justin_feb_17_2015</code>




I am assuming your have already cloned and checkedout a new branch, named correctly and have (SASS) installed.

* Open your terminal and navigate to your folder, enter this into the command line:

 <code>cd /path/to/folder/</code> You should now be in your folder.

* Now that you have done that, go ahead and do the same command but navigate to the (CSS) folder

* Next your're gonna want (SASS) to be watching for changes and output them in your (.CSS) file, enter this in the command line:

 <code>sass -w styles.scss:styles.css</code> Should return a message saying (SASS) is watching for changes.
  
*** You should be all set up and ready to code.
